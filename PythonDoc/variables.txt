Python Variables:
==================

* Variables are containers for storing data values.
* Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
* A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
* Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change 
 type after they have been set.

 Eg:

 x = 4 # x is of type int
 x = "Hello" # x is now of type str
 print(x)

* String variables :
--------------------

String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:

x = "Hello"
# is the same as
x = 'Hello'

* Assign Value to Multiple Variables:
--------------------------------------
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

* Assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:

x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)


* changing Variable value:
==========================

a = 25
b = a

print(a)
print(b)

b = 17

print(a)
print(b)
