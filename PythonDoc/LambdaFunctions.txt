* Python Lambda:
=================

* A lambda function is a small anonymous function.

* A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

* Syntax:
=========

lambda arguments : expression

* function Example:

def add(x, y):
    return x + y


print(add(5, 7))

* Written as a lambda:
======================

add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(5, 7))


* in conjunction with built-in function map:
=============================================

* map applies the function to all values in the sequence

def double(x):
    return x * 2


sequence = [1, 3, 5, 9]

doubled = [
    double(x) for x in sequence
]  # Put the result of double(x) in a new list, for each of the values in `sequence`
doubled = map(double, sequence)
print(list(doubled))

*  Written as a lambda

sequence = [1, 3, 5, 9]

doubled = map(lambda x: x * 2, sequence)
print(list(doubled))


* Lambdas are just functions without a name.
* They are used to return a value calculated from its parameters.
